## Database Structure

The project uses SQLite with the following tables:

- movies: Stores movie information
- theaters: Cinema theaters/rooms
- showings: Movie screening times
- seats: Individual seats in theaters
- bookings: Customer bookings
- booked_seats: Seats included in bookings
- users: User accounts

## API Endpoints

### Movies

- GET /api/movies - List all movies
- GET /api/movies/:id - Get one movie details
- GET /api/movies/:id/showings â€“ All showings for movie

### Showings

- GET /api/showings - List all showings
- GET /api/showings/:id - Get showing info
- GET /api/seats/:showingId/available â€“ Available seats for showing

### Bookings

- POST /api/bookings - Create a new booking
- GET /api/bookings/:userId - Get bookings for a user

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Seed script automatically deletes and resets all tables when run in development.
- To reset database: run NODE_ENV=development node server/seeds/seedAll.js
- Database is .gitignored, each dev gets their own local DB.
